                    <h3>Γειά σου!</h3>
                    <h3>Hello!</h3>
                    <p>My name is André, and I’m from São Paulo, Brazil. In this article, I’d like to introduce myself, share a bit of my
                        background, and explain why I created this website.</p>

                    <h3>A little about me</h3>

                    <p>I’ve always been a curious person. Since childhood, I’ve had a strong desire to understand how and why things exist, how they work, and what’s behind them. This curiosity applies to objects, people, and even the universe. I enjoy learning a bit about everything—from turning plastic bags into gasoline, to human psychology, to the origins of languages spoken by Paleolithic tribes.</p>
                    
                    <h3>My education</h3>

                    <p>I hold a technical degree in Industrial Automation and Electronics from SENAI (Serviço Nacional de Aprendizagem Industrial), a Brazilian institution focused on industrial and technical education. You could compare it to a blend of Community Colleges and Trade Schools in the U.S., or Further Education colleges in the U.K., depending on the program type. SENAI offers free courses, technical diplomas, and even undergraduate degrees, all geared toward industry.</p>
